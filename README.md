React & Redux Project — Udacity React Developer Nanodegree

This is the second project of the [React Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

* [MyReads](https://github.com/mmlak-0109/reactnd-project-myreads) — React Fundamentals Project
* [Would You Rather](https://github.com/mmlak-0109/reactnd-project-would-you-rather) — React & Redux Project

## Project Overview:

'Would You Rather' is a quiz based game which allows users to login, answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard. The project emphasizes using React & Redux to build the application. Redux store is used to persist information as we interact with the application.

## How to Load the App

First, navigate to the directory where you want to save the app and run this code:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mmlak-0109/reactnd-project-would-you-rather.git
```
Next, you can use ```npm``` or ```yarn``` package manager to install dependencies.
### ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```

Finally, once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the development server with

### ```npm start```  or  ```yarn start```

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app.  If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.
